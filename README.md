**Welcome to Gabriola Connects!** 🏝️

## What is Gabriola Connects?

Gabriola Connects is a free, community-driven platform built by islanders, for islanders. We created this website to help our community of 4,500 residents stay connected, informed, and engaged with what's happening on Gabriola Island.

**Website:** [gabriolaconnects.ca](https://gabriolaconnects.ca)

## Why We Built This

Living on Gabriola Island is wonderful, but staying informed about community events, local services, and island news can be challenging. Information gets scattered across different websites, social media groups, bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth.

We experienced this firsthand and decided to do something about it. **Gabriola Connects' goal is to bring everything together** in one easy-to-use place, making it simple to:

- **Discover** what's happening on the island
- **Connect** with your neighbors
- **Support** local businesses
- **Stay informed** about ferry schedules and community alerts

## What You Can Do Right Now

### 📅 Community Calendar

**The calendar functionality is built and ready - we're now working to fill it with live event data.**

Our vision is to create a **single, comprehensive calendar** where islanders can find every community event, workshop, market, and gathering happening on Gabriola. No more checking multiple websites, Facebook groups, and bulletin boards.

**Where We Are Now:**
The calendar works beautifully, but we're still in the process of connecting with island organizations to populate it with their events.

**Our Collaboration Plan:**
We're actively reaching out to collaborate with community organizations to share their events on our platform, starting with the **Gabriola Island Chamber of Commerce**. Our goal is to eventually partner with all of these incredible island groups:

**Community & Business:**
- Gabriola Island Chamber of Commerce
- People for a Healthy Community (PHC)
- Sustainable Gabriola

**Arts & Culture:**
- Gabriola Arts Council
- Poetry Gabriola
- Lulu Performing Arts
- Gabriola Arts & Heritage Centre (GAHC)

**Recreation & Sports:**
- Gabriola Recreation Society
- Gabriola Golf & Country Club
- Gabriola Lands and Trails Trust (GaLTT)
- Gabriola Dragon Boat Club
- Gabriola Power and Sail Squadron

**Social & Senior Services:**
- Rollo Centre (Gabriola Seniors Centre)
- Gabriola Senior Citizens Association
- Gabriola Lions Club

**Education, Youth & Family:**
- The Haven
- Gabriola Library / Friends of the Library
- Hope Centre
- Gabriola Elementary School (GES)

**Markets, Fairs & Environmental:**
- Gabriola Commons
- AGI Co-op
- Gabriola Garden Club
- Gabriola Rod, Gun & Conservation Club
- Gabriola Tool Library

**Community Venues:**
- Community Hall
- Agricultural Hall
- Silva Bay Marina

**The Goal:** One calendar. All events. Easy access for everyone.

**In the meantime,** island residents and organizations can post their own events to help build our community calendar. Every event added helps connect more islanders with what's happening in our community.

### 💬 Community Forum

**A space for open, honest conversation among neighbors.**

The Gabriola Connects forum is designed to allow **free-flowing discussion about any topic** that matters to our community. We believe in open dialogue and minimal censorship.

**Our Philosophy:**
- ✅ Discuss community issues, ask questions, share knowledge
- ✅ Debate topics respectfully, even when opinions differ
- ✅ Share local information, recommendations, and experiences
- ✅ Connect with neighbors on topics that matter to you
- ✅ Self-moderate through community standards and mutual respect

**What's Not Allowed:**
We have only three firm boundaries, all based on Canadian law and basic human decency:
- ❌ Child exploitation in any form
- ❌ Pornography or sexually explicit content
- ❌ Activities that are illegal under Canadian law

**Beyond these clear lines, we trust our community to engage in good faith.** Disagreement is welcome. Different perspectives make us stronger. We're all neighbors here.

**Community Moderation:**
Volunteer moderators help maintain a respectful environment and address issues when they arise, but their role is light-touch. The forum is yours to use, not control.

### 📖 Local Business Directory

**Find local services, shops, and businesses right here on Gabriola.**

Our directory complements the Gabriola Chamber of Commerce directory by providing another way for residents to discover and connect with local businesses. We're not competing - we're adding value to the existing ecosystem.

**Why Have Both?**
- Different platforms serve different needs
- More visibility helps all local businesses
- Residents benefit from multiple ways to find services
- Cross-listing increases the chance islanders find what they need

Support your island neighbors and keep our local economy thriving by choosing local first.

### ⛴️ Ferry Schedules

**BC Ferries schedules, conveniently accessible when you need them.**

We've built this feature to make it easier for islanders to check ferry times without hunting through multiple websites. It's a simple tool that we hope makes island life just a little bit smoother.

Quick access to departure times, current conditions, and schedule information - all in one place on Gabriola Connects.

### 🔔 Community Alerts

**Stay informed - on your terms.**

Our alert system is designed to help you be as informed (or as unplugged) as you want to be. You control what you see and when you see it.

- **Emergency alerts** - Critical information about safety, evacuations, or urgent community needs
- **Community announcements** - Important updates about island services, road closures, or public meetings
- **Event reminders** - Optional notifications about upcoming activities (if you choose to enable them)

**Your choice, always.** We believe you should decide how much information you want to receive. Whether you check alerts daily or only during emergencies, the system works the way you need it to.

Set your preferences to match your lifestyle - from "tell me everything" to "emergencies only" to "I'll check when I want to."

**What They CANNOT See:** Your private messages, your password (encrypted), your private contact information beyond what you choose to share publicly.

### 🛡️ How Your Data is Protected

**Public Posts Are Public:** Anything you post in the forum or calendar is visible to all users. Don't share personal information you want to keep private in public forums.

**Deleted Content:** When you delete a forum post, it's removed from public view but may remain in backups for a short period for technical reasons.

**Beta Stage:** As we're in beta, security is continuously being reviewed and improved. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us immediately.

### 🤝 Our Commitment

## A Note from the Creators

We built Gabriola Connects because we love this island and its people. We've lived here for over three decades and have experienced firsthand how challenging it can be to stay connected with everything happening in our community.

We hope it helps you discover events you'd otherwise miss, connect with neighbors you might not otherwise meet, find services you need, and feel more engaged with our incredible island community.

Gabriola Connects is far from perfect, and it's still growing and improving. We're excited to see how it evolves as more islanders join and help shape what it becomes.

Thank you for being part of our island community. We're looking forward to seeing how Gabriola Connects grows and improves with your input and participation.
